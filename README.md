# DRUGseq-tools
DRUGseq-tools is a collection of bioinfomatics analysis pipelines developed at XinRui EMED to process large-scale transcriptome sequencing data generated with Plastech-seq and PHD-seq. These pipelines take paired-end FASTQ files as input and generate output files which can be used for downstream data analysis as well as a summary of QC criteria.

Example command can be found in [quick_start](./docs/quick_start.md).

Detailed docs can be found in [manual](./docs/manual.md).
